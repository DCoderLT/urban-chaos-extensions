urban-chaos-extensions
======================

Some small improvements/additions to the old Mucky Foot game "Urban Chaos".

This repository contains source code for a small helper DLL with new functionality for "Urban Chaos". If you are unfamiliar with that game, see http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/urban_chaos for some details.

The DLL needs to be injected into the target process through [Syringe](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Syringe) ( branch `feat-injless` ). At the moment this is just a dump of old code I had reversed and added without thinking much about the bigger picture - cleanups and corrections should follow in the future.

*Note*: the code of the original game was reverse engineered, unfortunately I don't have the real source code.
